# SprintBreather

When you're not moving or jumping, sprint regenerates at roughly 2x faster.

A bepin mod.

## Installation
1. Install [Bepin](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/) if you haven't. I personally used the manual install and this process may not play nice with a mod manager.
2. In the right column, click v1.x.x (latest)
3. On that releases page, click TZ.SprintBreather.dll to download it
4. Move the dll to [steamInstallLocation]\steamapps\common\Lethal Company\BepInEx\plugins
5. If it doesn't work I guess DM me or whatever
